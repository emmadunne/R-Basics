## Let's explore a new dataset!
## The comments below provide some prompts for you to try out the code we've already used for yourself,
## or you can use this opportunity to search for new ways of doing things using good ol' Google

## The dataset we'll use is a simple one that comes built into tidyverse, check it out:
View(starwars)



# 1. Explore the data --------------------------------------------------------

## First explore the dataset and get comfortable with the what's inside it

# What does the dataset look like? 
View(starwars)


# How many different 'species' are there?


# What's the average height?
# And which species has the lowest average height (without guessing!)


# Anything else that you think might be useful to check?





# 2. Visualise the data ------------------------------------------------------


## Using pieces of code from the previous scripts, 
## and/or code you pull from Google searches yourself,
## create a plot that best represents an interesting story from the data


## Before you start plotting, might it be useful to filter or subset the main dataset to make things easier?













# 3. Test the data -----------------------------------------------------------


## Using the statistical tests we've already covered, or one you want to try yourself,
## provide a statistically-sound conclusion for a story shown by the data
